# Triton tutorials

These are my very rough notes as I learn to use [Triton](https://www.github.com/openai/triton). Hopefully you will find them useful.

# Contents

1. [GPU Basics](01_gpu_basics.ipynb)
2. [Vector Addition](02_vector_addition.ipynb)
3. [Matrix Multiplication](03_small_matrix_multiplication.ipynb)

# Install

To install Triton, just do `pip install triton`.  You need a CUDA-compatible GPU and CUDA installed to use it.

# References

Some material in these notebooks came from the following sources (and they're generally good documentation):

- [Triton tutorials](https://triton-lang.org/main/index.html)
- [NVIDIA CUDA guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html)
